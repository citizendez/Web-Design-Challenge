# Web-Design-Challenge
## Latitude  

For this project I created a visualization dashboard website using visualizations I created in a past project.  Specifically, I will be plotting weather data. 

This page has a landing page and a page for each plot with an explanation of what it means. There is a comparison page that allows the user to see all the visualizations at once. There is a Data page that allows user to look at the data that was used to create the visualizations.  I also included an additional data page. This data page looks at more extreme angles of the data by comparing temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed extremes.  

The navbar includes a link to each page, a drop-down menu that allows users  to navigate from plot to plot. A home button and the brand "Latitude" is also a nav element that will take you to the landing page    

Each plot is linked to the corresponding visualization page so that from any page you can click the plot and it will navigate you to that visualization's page.
